Notes on how to proceed with the download metrics aggregation
process:

Concept:
Local node download metrics are collected by every data node
publishing some information on the data corpus.
A node can be classified as an "aggregator" by defining the attribute
"aggregator" (at the Node level) and setting it to a list of "peer
groups".  This allows us to leverage a the previously know group
concept. 

Each designated aggregator will "crawl" download metrics from the
group members, defined in the "aggregator" attribute for that node.
Aggregator nodes manage both local and aggregated metrics.  Both types
of information can be requested by an external aggregator (based on
query request syntax).

Group levels...

Group A - a1, a2, a3, a4 (a5)
Group B - b1, b2, b3, b4 (b5)
Group C - c1, c2, c3, c4 (c5)

Top level Group
Group "ESGF" - a5, b5, (c5)

consider that c5 is in both groups "C" and "ESGF"
And manages 3 data warehouses: c5 (local), "C" and "ESGF"
